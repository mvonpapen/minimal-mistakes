Since 2019 I work as a data science consultant in the field of Life Sciences at Comma Soft AG in Bonn, Germany. Here, we are invested in research infrastructure in general and single-cell genomics in particular. Feel free to check out our analytics platform [FASTGenomics](https://www.fastgenomics.org), where we provide cloud-based data management and analytics for the single-cell community.

My academical background lies in Geophysics and Computational Neuroscience. As a Postdoc at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-6, IAS-6, INM-10) at the Juelich Research Centre I worked on the dynamical correlation structure of massively parallel spike trains and the validation of spiking neuronal networks. From my days working in the field of Clinical Neuroscience at Cologne and DÃ¼sseldorf, I am interested in causal inference using non-parametric Granger causality and transfer entropy. And, last but not least, my PhD topic plasma turbulence, namely Saturn's magnetospheric plasma dynamics and turbulent heating as well as critical balance in the solar wind, is still on my radar.
