I am an expert in statistical analysis, modelling and inference of coupling and causality in complex systems. I did my PhD in Space Physics at the University of Cologne with application in plasma turbulence of planetary magnetospheres. I then moved to the field of Neuroscience, where I worked on Deep Brain Stimulation data in Parkinson's disease and dynamical resting state networks derived from M/EEG and massively parallel spike trains. As a scientific coordinator and data science consultant I am skilled in project management and in the translation of real-world problems into quantitative models.

Apart from my work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and my two boys. Occasionally I play the saxophone or try to figure out new projects that typically involve learning new (coding) skills or methods while listening to Bob Dylan. 

# CV
<!-- COMMA -->
{% capture notice-text %}
Since 2019 I work as data science consultant in the Life Science team at Comma Soft in Bonn, Germany, with a focus on single-cell genomics in the industrial and academic sector. I am part of the team behind the single-cell analytics platform [FASTGenomics](https://www.fastgenomics.org) that provides cloud-based data management and analytical software environments for the single-cell community.

First to show that Saturn's magnetosphere is in a turbulent state using wavelet analysis of magnetic field data. Detected temporal and spatial patterns in nine years of data and developed a parametric model to explain observed electron temperatures.
